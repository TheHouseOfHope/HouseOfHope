## Training data (CSV only — not SQLite / not Azure SQL)

- **Training and offline notebooks** should load Lighthouse data from **`backend/SeedData/*.csv`** (the same committed CSVs the API uses to seed local SQLite in development). Use `ml-pipelines/ml_data.py` → `resolve_seed_data_dir()` in Python scripts, or set **`ML_SEED_DATA_DIR`** to override the folder.
- **Do not** point training pipelines at `*.sqlite` files or at production Azure SQL. Azure hosts no SQLite files; coupling training to a local DB drifts from what ships and from what runs in the cloud.
- **Runtime inference** (the .NET API) correctly reads the **configured database** (SQLite in dev, SQL Server on Azure) so staff see scores against live data. That is separate from how you **train** exported ONNX/JSON artifacts.

When the **deployed API** is rolled back to an older build but **main** still contains newer schema or endpoints, production and the repo can be out of sync until you redeploy a matching build or migrate the database. Training from `SeedData` keeps a single file-based source of truth for regenerating models regardless of where the API runs.

## ML pipelines catalog (`ml-pipelines/*.ipynb`)

Below, **predictive** means supervised models used for forecasting, ranking, or scores; **causal** means explicit causal identification (RCTs, IV, diff-in-diff, etc.). Unless stated otherwise, notebooks report **associational** patterns in observational data — useful for planning, not proof that changing one input *causes* an outcome.

### Integrated with the Lighthouse app (API / ONNX / committed artifacts)

`Donor_Churn_Analysis.ipynb` addresses the business problem of **prioritizing stewardship** when donors are at risk of lapsing (no meaningful gift in a forward window). It builds **time-respecting** features and labels, compares interpretable and high-performance models, and exports **`churn_model.onnx`** plus preprocessing metadata consumed by **`DonorChurnPredictionService`**. This is **predictive** scoring for operations (risk tiers, drivers), not causal attribution of why donors leave. The **frontend** surfaces churn tier on donor admin views and on **Reports & Analytics**.

`CaseManagement_Caseload_Ultimate.ipynb` supports **frontline case management**: early warning on **risk escalation**, **reintegration** signals, **NLP distress** on counseling notes, and a **caseload queue** narrative — aligned with `scripts/export_case_onnx.py` and **`CaseManagementPredictionService`** (multiple ONNX artifacts). It mixes **predictive** classifiers with **explanatory** interpretation (e.g. drivers of readiness) where the notebook calls that out; it does not establish causal effects of interventions. **Resident detail** and **Caseload Inventory** show model scores and recommended actions for authenticated staff.

`Safehouse_Performance_Analysis.ipynb` helps leadership **benchmark safehouses** on a composite outcome index versus operational intensity and caseload stress, exports **`safehouse_performance_model.onnx`** for **`SafehousePerformancePredictionService`**, and frames coefficients as **peer comparison**, not causal proof that increasing documentation *causes* better outcomes. The **Reports & Analytics** page consumes safehouse performance rows from the API for staff-facing comparison.

`SocialMedia_Growth_Analysis.ipynb` ties **social posts** to **engagement** and **referral-attributed giving**, uses **chronological** evaluation and leakage-aware feature sets, and feeds ONNX exports (**`social_media_engagement.onnx`**, **`social_media_donation.onnx`**) used by **`SocialMediaPredictionService`**. The analysis is **predictive** and associational (what correlates with referrals and engagement); causal claims require experiments. The admin **Post Optimizer** calls **`/ML/social-media/predict`** for what-if scoring.

### Offline analysis, design, and supporting artifacts

`Home_Visitation_Explanatory_Decision_Tree.ipynb` targets **safe, productive home visits** by learning a **shallow decision tree** over visit features and turning splits into an **SOP-style checklist**. It is **explanatory** (readable rules for training and supervision), not a production risk score. It writes **`backend/Models/home_visit_sop_insights.json`** for intended API/caseload use; treat outputs as **associational** drivers, not causal. **Frontend wiring** for this JSON should be verified against the live API when exposed.

`CaseManagement_Analysis.ipynb` is an earlier **caseload decision-support** notebook: **risk escalation** and **reintegration** targets, heuristic vs ML comparisons, ethics and metrics — **predictive** in intent with interpretability sections that remain **non-causal**. It overlaps thematically with `CaseManagement_Caseload_Ultimate.ipynb`; the **Ultimate** notebook and export scripts are the path for **deployed** ONNX aligned with the .NET services.

`Donor_Analysis.ipynb` is a **fundraising and donor-ecosystem** study: segmentation, campaign and channel views, allocations to safehouses/programs, and social referral links. It is primarily **descriptive** and **exploratory**, with analyses that can inform **predictive** product choices but without shipping a single production classifier in this repo’s API surface.

`ML_Model_Design_Playbook.ipynb` is a **design brief**: it maps business questions to targets, features, leakage checks, and metrics across Lighthouse CSV domains so teams can **prioritize what to build**. It is not a deployed model pipeline; any “causal” language in course-style sections should be read as **planning guidance**, not identified causal estimates.

`Unified_Platform_System_Design.ipynb` is **systems narrative plus optional quantification**: how donors, residents, partners, and social outreach connect through shared entities (safehouses, allocations, monthly metrics). It supports **strategic communication** and data literacy; it is not predictive or causal modeling.
